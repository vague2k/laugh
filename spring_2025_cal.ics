 ly? You may also consider the architecture\, how are spaces designed\, wha
 t spaces are occupied by whom? Is there a difference between genders\, aut
 horities\, young/elders or do they all occupy the same place? Who gets up 
 first at the table\, who serves? Are characters taking turns to speak\, wh

 \, keep the threads as interesting discussions on the topic. Remember we a
 re all learning from one another\, expand on the conversation\, provide fa

  idea is to analyze certain aspects by discussing them.\n\n**NOTE: when di
 scussing documentaries\, and movies look for elements that confirm or expa
 nd on the themes from the readings rather than merely pointing out the plo
 t.**\n\nMore than just thinking about the plot\, you need to look at every
  detail so that you can compare how your observations and the course conte
 nt are related.\nExamples of elements to observe: characters dress code\, 
 do elders and youth dress alike? Do different social classes dress similar
 ly? You may also consider the architecture\, how are spaces designed\, wha
 t spaces are occupied by whom? Is there a difference between genders\, aut
 horities\, young/elders or do they all occupy the same place? Who gets up 
 first at the table\, who serves? Are characters taking turns to speak\, wh
 ich lines does each say\, who has the last word\, etc?  & finally... what
  does it all mean?\nHow do your observations relate to the content of the 
 course?\n\n \n\n* ["How do I reply to a discussion."] (https://community.
